      <h1 class="text-center">Cryptomator 1.3.0-rc1</h1>
      <p>When we first started with Cryptomator, we had all the source code in one big project. In preparation for the FUSE/Dokany integration, we wanted to modularize its core components. In fact, we had to completely rewrite Cryptomator. The cryptographic code is now available as <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib">CryptoLib</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs">CryptoFS</a>. With that, we're able to write more managable adapters like <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/webdav-nio-adapter">WebDAV</a> and FUSE/Dokany for version 1.4.</p>
      <h2 class="text-center">How to Test</h2>
      <p>We'd like to keep the distribution simple. We're offering binaries for Windows (64 Bit), macOS, and Debian (64 Bit).</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://bintray.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/download_file?file_path=Cryptomator-1.3.0-rc1-x64.exe">Download Cryptomator 1.3.0-rc1 for Windows (64 Bit)</a></li>

      </ul>
      <p>If your system is not listed, you can also download version 1.3.0-rc1 as a JAR file <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.3.0-rc1">here</a>, which requires the following installed on your system:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Java 8 (min. 8u51, we recommend to use the current version)</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html">JCE unlimited strength policy files</a> (needed for 256-bit keys)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Please use a test vault or ideally a backup/copy of your productive vault.</strong> If Cryptomator isn't behaving as expected and the issue isn't reproducible with version 1.2, please let us know.</p>
